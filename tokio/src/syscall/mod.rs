//! The [syscall] module is intended to provide a centralized location
//! for interacting with OS resources such as disks and network.
//!
//! This requires both the `"test-util"` feature to be enabled as well
//! as the `--cfg tokio_unstable` flag to be supplied.
//!
//! ## Extension
//! The Syscall trait allows hooking into implementations of Tokio
//! disk and networking resources to supply alternate implementations
//! or mocks.
//!
//! Extension requires compiling with `--cfg tokio_unstable` in addition
//! to the `syscall` feature flag.
